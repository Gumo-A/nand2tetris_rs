[Nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
is a wonderful project that aims to teach anyone interested how computer
systems work from its most basic components up to high-level programming
languages.

The idea is that we are given a simple logic gate *nand* from which we have
to build up other gates like *and* or *xor*, from which we have to contruct
more complex gates, build the components that allow us to do arithmetic operations,
and so on up to a fully-functioning Operating System that can play the game Tetris.

I've taken on the challenge myself by trying to follow the contents of
its book, but by implementing everything in a language of my choice, Rust.
