[Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
is a wonderful project that aims to teach anyone interested how computer
systems work from its most basic components up to high-level programming
languages.

The idea is that we are given a simple logic gate [*nand*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate)
from which we have to build up other gates like *and* or *xor*.
With these, we are asked to build more complex gates, components that allow
us to do arithmetic operations, and so on up to a fully-functioning operating system
that can play the game Tetris.

I've taken on the challenge myself by trying to follow the contents of
its book, but by implementing everything in a language of my choice, Rust.
